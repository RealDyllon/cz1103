# Title : EX1 - speed

## Content

Write a C program to read the time (in seconds) and distance (in kilometers) covered by a moving object, calculate the speed in kilometers per second, and display the speed on the screen. The relevant formula is: speed = distance/time. The output should be in the following format: “The speed is [the speed value] km/sec.”

Sample input and output sessions are given below:

### (1) Test Case 1

Enter distance (in km):
_1_
Enter time (in sec):
_10_
The speed is 0.10 km/sec

### (2) Test Case 2

Enter distance (in km):
_10_
Enter time (in sec):
_5_
The speed is 2.00 km/sec
