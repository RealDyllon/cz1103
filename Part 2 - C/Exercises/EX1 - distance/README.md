# Title : EX1 - distance

## Content

The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by sqrt((x2-x1)\*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)\*(y2-y1)).

Write a C program that reads the (x, y) coordinates for two points, computes the distance between the two points.

Sample input and output sessions are given below:

### (1) Test Case 1

Enter first point x1 y1:
_1 5_
Enter second point x2 y2:
_2 7_
The distance is 2.24

### (2) Test Case 2

Enter first point x1 y1:
_1 1_
Enter second point x2 y2:
_5 5_
The distance is 5.66
