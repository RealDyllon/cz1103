# Title : EX1 - power

## Content

Write a C program that reads the user input on the current and resistance, and displays the power loss of the cable on the screen. The relevant formula is P = I2R, where P is the power loss in watts, I is the current in amperes and R is the resistance in ohms.

Sample input and output sessions are given below:

### (1) Test Case 1

Enter the current:

_12_

Enter the resistance:

_1.5_

The power loss: 216.00

### (2) Test Case 2

Enter the current:

_5_

Enter the resistance:

_0.5_

The power loss: 12.50
