# Title : EX1 - cylinder

## Content

Write a C program that computes the volume and surface area of a cylinder. The program reads the user input on the radius and height of the cylinder, and then computes the volume and surface area of the cylinder. The relevant formulas are volume = πr2h and surface area = 2πrh + 2πr2, where r is the radius and h is the height.

Sample input and output sessions are given below:

### (1) Test Case 1

Enter the radius:
_5_
Enter the height:
_8_
The volume is: 628.32
The surface area is: 408.41

### (2) Test Case 2

Enter the radius:
_1_
Enter the height:
_5_
The volume is: 15.71
The surface area is: 37.70
